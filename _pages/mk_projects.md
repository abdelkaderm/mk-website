 Empirical-statistical downscaling/extremely simple data (ESD, 2012-present). An analytical tool for analysing and visualising climate data for station data as well as gridded model results. Designed to be flexible, intuitive, and efficient. It is based on the R-environment, and consists of an R-package that comes with code, documentation and help pages. The source code is free of access and is available at Github repository. It is supported by Rmarkdown scripts which is a tool for documenting work done within R and R-shiny which is a web-based tool for making apps running R. All these tools work seamlessly with Rstudio.

The Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment within the World Climate Research Programme (CORDEX, ongoing). This ongoing European collaboration aims at advancing and coordinating the science and application of regional climate downscaling through global partnerships. My main contribution has been in the implementation of the new CORDEX-ESD branch dealing with integrating statistical downscaling approaches in the general framework.

Data Evaluation for Climate Models (DECM, 2016-2019). This project aims at assessing user requirements, science and gaps in climate model data delivery concerning CMIP and Euro-CORDEX data. It focuses strongly on user requirements, data inventory and scientific assessment and gap analysis to get a strong view of user-friendly and fit-for-purpose key performance indicators, tools and service to be recommended for the Evaluation and Quality Control framework. My main contribution was in the development of a prototype based on a web application to evaluate (global and regional) climate models and demonstrate the added value to the 3CS COPERNICUS programme through a two-way engagement process with users and stakeholders. https://climate.copernicus.eu/data-evaluation-climate-models

Research experience

Horizon 2020 programmes on European Union's Research and Innovation within the Copernicus Climate Change Services 3S - Data 

EU-FP7 programmes on European Union's Research and Innovation
A pan European framework for strengthening critical infrastructure resilience for climate change (EU-CIRCLE,  2015-2018). This project aims to derive an innovative framework for supporting the interconnected European Infrastructure’s resilience to climate pressures, supported by an end-to-end modelling environment along with new analyses were developed to understand interdependencies, validate results, and describe findings by integrating resilience model, existing modelling tools, and data in a standardised manner. Web link at www.eu-circle.eu/.
Seasonal-to-decadal climate Prediction for the improvement of European Climate Services (SPECS, 2012-2016). The main objective is to improve understanding and provide seamless predictions of the future frequency of high-impact, extreme climatic events, along with prediction uncertainty. http://www.specs-fp7.eu/
EEA/Norway Grants 2014-17 Research cooperation programme
Climate change impact assessment for selected sectors in Poland (CHASE-PL, 2014-2017). This project aims at contributing to the improvement of understanding of climate change in Poland and its impacts on selected sectors in the country. It extended in numerous ways the state-of-the-art of the detection of change, projections of climate change and its impacts on water management, ecosystems and biodiversity, agriculture and food production. http://chase-pl.pl/, MET Norway leader.
COST Action programme
VALUE on Validating and Integrating Downscaling Methods for Climate Change Research (ES-1102, http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/essem/ES1102. My main contribution was to train students on using empirical-statistical downscaling approaches.
Norwegian Research council, Nordic council of ministers
Relevant, Reliable, and robust local scale climate projections for Norway (R3, 2017-2019). The main objective of the project is to develop and implement innovative, integrated approaches to produce reliable local-scale climate projections for communities and stakeholders in Norway. The secondary objectives are to engage with users and stakeholders in the co-production of climate understanding; tailor the provision of climate information to their needs and experience new ways that are relevant to their organizational structures and cultures. The project also focuses on using hybrid (physically and statistically) based approaches to downscale robust climate change signals from global climate models in a way that mitigates systematic biases over the Northeast Atlantic region; to develop decision-relevant climate information in collaboration with project stakeholders; and to demonstrate the added-value of the integrated approach from both the stakeholder and scientific perspectives. https://sites.google.com/view/r3-climate/about-r3?authuser=0
Climate Extremes, Air Pollution and Agro-ecosystems (CiXPAG, 2016-2019). This project aims at  investigating the complex interactions between climate extremes, air pollution and agricultural ecosystems. It uses global and regional climate model simulations in combination with statistical downscaling approaches to provide better information on climate and climate extremes and their changes relevant to agriculture. https://cicero.oslo.no/en/posts/projects/cixpag-interaction-of-climate-extremes-air-pollution-and-agro-ecosystems
The response of the hydrological system in India to climate change (INDICE, 2013-2015). The overall aim of the project is to understand the impact of climate change on cryospheric contribution to rivers in western Himalaya and the subsequent impact on water resource availability and socio-economic status of the local community. A second objective was on capacity building of Indian partners.

MIST II climate projections. This project consisted of performing i) a literature study on observations/reanalysis data sets available for Turkey, ii) an empirical-statistical downscaling (ESD), iii) evaluation of global climate models and dynamic downscaling and iv) storm track analyzes in Norway. The project was conducted in close collaboration with Statkraft, which is one of the leading companies in hydropower internationally and Europe’s largest generator of renewable energy.
