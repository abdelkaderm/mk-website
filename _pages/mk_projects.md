  Empirical-statistical downscaling toolbox include tools for analysing and visualising climate data for station data as well as gridded model results. Designed to be flexible, intuitive, and efficient. It is based on the R-environment, and consists of an R-package that comes with code, documentation and help pages. The source code is free of access and is available at Github repository. It is supported by Rmarkdown scripts which is a tool for documenting work done within R and R-shiny which is a web-based tool for making apps running R. All these tools work seamlessly with Rstudio.

  Climate change impact assessment for selected sectors in Poland. This project aims at contributing to the improvement of understanding of climate change in Poland and its impacts on selected sectors in the country. It extended in numerous ways the state-of-the-art of the detection of change, projections of climate change and its impacts on water management, ecosystems and biodiversity, agriculture and food production.<br>

Relevant, Reliable, and robust local scale climate projections for Norway. The main objective of the project is to develop and implement innovative, integrated approaches to produce reliable local-scale climate projections for communities and stakeholders in Norway. The secondary objectives are to engage with users and stakeholders in the co-production of climate understanding; tailor the provision of climate information to their needs and experience new ways that are relevant to their organizational structures and cultures. The project also focuses on using hybrid (physically and statistically) based approaches to downscale robust climate change signals from global climate models in a way that mitigates systematic biases over the Northeast Atlantic region; to develop decision-relevant climate information in collaboration with project stakeholders; and to demonstrate the added-value of the integrated approach from both the stakeholder and scientific perspectives.<br>
