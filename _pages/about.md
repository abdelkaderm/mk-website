WeaMyL project aims at enhancing the accuracy, performance and reliability of national nowcasting warning systems by the use of machine learning (ML) techniques applied on radar, satellite and weather stations’ observations. The focus will be on obtaining higher precision in predicting the occurrence and the areas affected by severe meteorological phenomena, as well as attaining lower decision times (compared to current, exclusively human decision times). The project’s main goal is to automate the nowcasting warning systems by creating a ML driven platform for early and accurate forecast of severe phenomena. Thus, it is aimed to be the backbone of a new framework for imminent severe weather detection adapted to current technological possibilities.

## Main objectives

The main objectives of the project are  the following:

* Development and scientific validation of climate analyses
* Downscaling of global climate models tailored for accurate climate prediction.
* Development and user evaluation of the downscaling protocol, a large database containing climate data.
